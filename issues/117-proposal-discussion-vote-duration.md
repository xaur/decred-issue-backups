This issue captures a concern that pre-vote discussion and vote itself are too short, which may negatively affect comment and vote engagement.

Personal "late voter" perspective: studying a typical proposal easily takes me 2+ hours. If several proposal surface concurrently, I need some 8-10 hours to form opinions and come up vote choices for the batch. When proposals show up on Politeia, they sort of demand that I allocate time among other activities, usually within ~1 week. As a result, I barely make it with some proposals, and a few I skipped entirely.

This is a manifestation of the "attention span" problem that was anticipated well before the launch of Politeia. People are busy and can only afford X hours per week on the proposal activity.

Perhaps I'm just bad at organizing my time and this issue is to learn if many people are having this problem. If not, close this issue and use it as a reference.

As a general rule, I would suggest longer discussion and voting windows for proposals with bigger impact (in both spend and policy). For anything larger than $50K, I think a default should be 14 days to discuss _on Politeia_ and 14 days to vote.

One idea to study the problem better is to survey how long people spend to decide on an average proposal.
