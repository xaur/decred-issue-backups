There seems to be [consensus](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154816763913079VGeOt:decred.org) that Decred would benefit from representation at open source software development and hacker conferences.

This issue is about researching these conferences, figuring out which would be a good fit for Decred, what kind of presence we should aim for, what kind of session might work, etc.

Here are some examples that have been given, to get the ball rolling:

1. [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/) - next one starts Feb 2nd, call opens around August
1. [DEFCON](https://www.defcon.org/) - Next one starts Aug 8th, calls just opened
1. [CCC](https://events.ccc.de/) - Main event occurs end of December each year

Please add more possible events, feel free to discuss the merits of each here and add descriptions of what you find out if you look into one of these conferences.
