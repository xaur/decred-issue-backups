Low volume notification channels for infrastructure operators such as PoW pools, VSPs, exchanges, payment processors and others.

Possible channels:

* RSS feed
* email newsletter or mailing list
* Matrix room and/or DM bot
* dedicated Twitter account and/or DM bot
* Telegram room and/or DM bot

Some might prefer anonymous/accountless (RSS) or direct (email, DM) channels for privacy reasons, because in public group all members can enumerated.

Notes:

* must be low volume
* maximally automate dispatch of the same message to various channels
* consider importance levels:
  * critical: pause everything else or wake up at night and rush to fix a critical issue
  * important: significant improvements are possible, upgrade on nearest opportunity
  * normal: improvements, upgrade when feasible

Rollout:

* Initially notify all possibly interested parties about such channels.
* Add info about these channels to onboarding flows so operators learn about them.
