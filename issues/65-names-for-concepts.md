Below are concepts whose names were discussed. I believe most are settled now, this issue is to make a record of that.

Concepts are numbered, name candidates are bullets below them.

- (1) person who holds DCR but does nothing with it
  * holder
  * investor
- (2) person who buys tickets only for profit, he always votes 'yes' for blocks and 'abstain' for consensus changes and doesn't care
  * passive voter
- (3) the process for (2)
  * passive voting
- (4) person who buys tickets, cares to react on miner misbehavior and actively votes for consensus changes
  * voter
- (5) voting for blocks
  * block voting
- (6) voting for consensus changes
  * consensus voting
  * consensus rule voting (used [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/733/files))
  * agenda voting
- (7) person voting for Politeia proposals
  * Politeia voter
  * proposal voter
- (8) the process for (7)
  * Politeia voting
  * proposal voting
- (9) "vote to disapprove the regular transactions of block N-1"
  * disapprove block
- (10) block that did no pass vote in (9)
  * disapproved block
  * stripped block
  * punished block
- (11) a kind of SPV that is specifically based on client-side filters; must distinguish from a) 'light' wallets [here](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv/) that rely on 3rd party service, b) most widespread SPV based on bloom filters (Electrum); ideally the term conveys increased privacy
- (12) Decred's hybrid PoW+PoS consensus algorithm
  * see #54
- (13) the decision to forgo liquidity on exchange for the right to participate in governance
  * "skin in the game" is not precise enough - can mean just holding of the asset
- (14) smaller units like 1e-6 DCR, 1e-8 DCR, etc
  * see #129

### Discussions

* [2019-03-20](https://matrix.to/#/!lbzTjhzNbIaDbuAxkS:decred.org/$155309851735051wGBlh:decred.org): "skin in the game" is hackneyed and vague, people have it in all crypto projects. The decision to forgo liquidity on exchange for the right to participate in governance warrants a term that is more meaningful and reflective of the difference between Decred and other projects; name for staking holder; people aren't going to understand a new concept until you explain it to them regardless of what you call it
