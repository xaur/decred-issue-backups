Recent events [showed](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a6ywpj/deleted_threads_with_valuable_discussion/) that there is one attack/sabotage vector on Reddit: create threads, trigger a discussion, wait people to spend time and attention, delete threads. Our moderators cannot block such attack because it's impossible to disallow users from deleting their stuff.

This is a good opportunity to think about a Reddit replacement that would also address this and other long standing issues with Reddit, some of them:

* post and comment vote manipulation from possibly any account
* posts and comments can be deleted by author without admin approval even if content was generated in response
* discussions can get hidden by downvotes (possible from external forces) and cannot be shown or snapshotted without javascript
* covert quoting bots and covert promoters litter the subreddit
* groups of randos pop out of nowhere and generate FUD around a small issue or even fake FUD
* no way to backup all good content generated by the community

A replacement can look like Reddit and be based on Politeia, with _at least_ the following properties:

* spam resistance
  * registration has a small DCR fee
  * posts may or may not require a fee -- open to discussion (perhaps just the reg fee will cut most of the junk)
* data can be fetched and audited by anyone by just cloning the Git repo
* posts and comments cannot be deleted without admin approval
  * this protects from attention grab attack
* posts and commens cannot be hidden with downvotes
* transparent censorship

Besides Politeia, another interesting possible foundation is Matrix protocol. It may give opportunities to deeply integrate with chats. I don't know Matrix to see if the solution built on it can satisfy all fundamental requirements.
