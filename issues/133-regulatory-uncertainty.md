* [2019-06-14](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360029196512): Binance: announced they will stop deposits and trading on Sep 12 for users that "are not in accordance" with the updated terms. This was an indirect announcement of restricting US customers, as the updated terms [said](https://archive.today/TPdKI) "Binance is unable to provide services to any U.S. person". The terms were later [updated](https://archive.today/mSvLV) with a more general statement "may restrict or deny the Services in certain countries at its discretion". Same day they [announced](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/346119082624540672/Binance-Announces-Partnership-with-BAM-to-Launch-US-Exchange) a launch of a FinCEN-registered Binance.US exchange specifically for US customers. According to [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/06/14/us-customers-to-be-blocked-from-trading-on-binance-com/), US accounted for 15% of Binance.com's traffic, down from 30% since early 2018.
